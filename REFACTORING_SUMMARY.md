# LiveGraphs Static - Refactoring Summary

## High-Priority Improvements Identified

### 1. âœ… Fixed Type Safety Issues
- Fixed TypeScript errors in `next.config.ts` related to webpack types
- Fixed chart type issues in `AnalyticsChart.tsx` using discriminated unions
- All type checking now passes

### 2. Component Duplication (High Priority)
**Issue**: We have duplicate chart components - regular versions using Chart.js and "Shadcn" versions using Recharts
**Examples**:
- `DailyCostTrendChart.tsx` vs `DailyCostTrendChartShadcn.tsx`
- `GaugeChart.tsx` vs `GaugeChartShadcn.tsx` (plus Alt and Circular variants)
- `HistogramChart.tsx` vs `HistogramChartShadcn.tsx`
- And 7+ more pairs

**Recommendation**: Standardize on one charting library (preferably Recharts/Shadcn for consistency with the UI library)

### 3. Large Hook Refactoring (Started but Reverted)
**Issue**: `useDatabaseOperations` hook is 418 lines doing too much
**Attempted**: Split into smaller hooks:
- `useDateRangeStorage` - localStorage management
- `useDataLoader` - data loading and caching
- `useDataExport` - CSV export functionality
- `useAutoLoadData` - automatic data loading logic

**Status**: Reverted due to complexity - needs careful planning

### 4. ClientDashboard Component Complexity
**Issue**: Main dashboard component has too many responsibilities (176 lines)
**Problems**:
- Mixed concerns (UI state, business logic, presentation)
- Complex conditional rendering
- Too many state variables and hooks

### 5. DataProcessor Optimization Opportunities
**File**: `src/lib/dataProcessor.ts` (396 lines)
**Issues**:
- Multiple separate SQL queries that could be combined
- Repeated date range filtering in every query
- Manual data transformation with lots of repetitive mapping
- No query batching

### 6. Console.log Statements
Multiple console.log statements found in production code that should be removed or replaced with proper logging

### 7. Error Handling
Current error handling uses basic try/catch with toast notifications. Could benefit from:
- Centralized error handling
- Error boundaries for React components
- Better error context for debugging

## Recommended Refactoring Priority

1. **Remove duplicate chart components** - Choose either Chart.js or Recharts and standardize
2. **Split ClientDashboard** into smaller, focused components
3. **Optimize dataProcessor** with query batching and memoization
4. **Refactor useDatabaseOperations** carefully with proper testing
5. **Add proper logging** instead of console.log
6. **Implement error boundaries** for better error handling

## Testing Status
- Fixed failing test in `AnalyticsChart.test.tsx`
- Some warnings in chart tests about dimensions (test environment issue)
- Overall test suite is mostly healthy

## Performance Considerations
- All data processing happens client-side
- Large datasets may impact browser performance
- Consider implementing:
  - Virtual scrolling for large lists
  - Progressive data loading
  - Web Workers for heavy computations
